# watermarker

### Description
A program I wrote for adding watermarks to photos using the [Python Imaging Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) (PIL) 

### Instructions
Create a target directory for your watermarked photos before executing the program. When ready, run the program by entering `python watermarker.py` in console.

Provide full paths without trailing slashes to your watermark, input, and output directories. The script currently only looks for files ending in `.JPG` but you can edit this in the script itself.
