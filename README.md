# watermarker

### Description
A program I wrote for scaling photos down to 1080p and adding watermarks using the [Python Imaging Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) (PIL) with Python 2.7. I made and 'tested' this while I used Ubuntu 14.04 so it may work alright on MacOS but unlikely for Windows unless through [Bash on Ubuntu on Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about).

### Instructions
install PIL (for Ubuntu but there are MacOS instructions online)
`sudo apt-get install python-pil`

Run the program by executing the following command:
`python watermarker.py`

Follow the prompts and watermarked images should end up in the `output` directory.
