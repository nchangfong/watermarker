# watermarker

### Description
A program I wrote for scaling photos to 1080p and adding watermarks using the [Python Imaging Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) (PIL) with Python 2.7. I made this to use with Ubuntu 14.04 so might work okay on MacOS but unlikely for Windows.

### Instructions
Run the program by executing the following command:
`python watermarker.py`

Follow the prompts and watermarked images should end up in the `output` directory.
