# watermarker

### Description
A program I wrote for adding watermarks to photos using the [Python Imaging Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) (PIL) 

### Instructions
in the watermarker directory create `input`, `output`, and `watermarks` directories.

`mkdir input output watermarks`

Your file structure should look like this:
```
├── input/
├── output/
├── README.md
├── watermarker.py
├── watermarks/
```

Place all input files in `input/` as `.JPG` (case-sensitive for now)

Place watermark image in `watermarks/`

Execute program by executing following command:
`python watermarker.py`

Enter the filename of watermark you'd like to use when prompted and wait for program to finish execution.
